// Generates a message like: User 123 logged into the system from 127.0.0.1
$info = [
        'id' => $user->id,
        'ip_address' => $this->request->ip_address()
];

log_message('info', 'User {id} logged into the system from {ip_address}', $info);


MAYBE log level alert for someone has tried logging in unsuccessfully 3 times.


- Log User Login (include success true/false and IPs)
- Add an AUDIT Log level
- Log user actions to AUDIT Level
- 

    public $handlers = [
        // File Handler
        'CodeIgniter\Log\Handlers\FileHandler' => [
            'handles' => ['critical', 'alert', 'emergency', 'debug', 'error', 'info', 'notice', 'warning'],
        ],
    ];

Use notice log level for auditing.
